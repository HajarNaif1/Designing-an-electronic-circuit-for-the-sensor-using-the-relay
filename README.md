# Designing an electronic circuit for the sensor using the relay
# :black_circle: *Concept the relay* :bulb::arrow_down::
##### :one: The relay is the device that open or closes the contacts to cause the operation of the other electric control. It detects the intolerable or undesirable condition with an assigned area and gives the commands to the circuit breaker to disconnect the affected area. Thus protects the system from damage
##### :two: can be controlled by Arduino or any micro , controller

# :black_circle: *Working Principle of Relay* :loud_sound::
##### - It works on the principle of an electromagnetic attraction. When the circuit of the relay senses the fault current, it energises the electromagnetic field which produces the temporary magnetic field :hammer_and_wrench:
